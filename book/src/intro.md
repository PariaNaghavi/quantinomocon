# Introduction

This book and its companion code are wildly incomplete, and may change dramatically as the project progresses.

## What is this book?

In this book, we'll walk through some of the key elements of a quantum computing compiler stack, using Rust various Rust libraries to help us out along the way. Our tour of quantum compilation will necessarily be in terms of proof-of-concept examples, more than anything immediately practical, but the core ideas and techniques will apply to varying degrees for any quantum compilation workflow targeting quantum simulators or even hardware.

The companion code for this book is available at [https://github.com/qrust-dev/quantinomocon](https://github.com/qrust-dev/quantinomocon).

## Who is this book for?

This book is **not** for teaching quantum programming or quantum software developmentâ€” if you're interested in writing quantum programs as a user or a quantum developer, great! You likely don't need this book, and may find it somewhere on the line from intensely boring to mildly horrifying. If you want to read this book anyway, welcome aboard, and enjoy the mess!

On the other hand, if you're interested in learning more about what goes on behind the scenes of your favorite quantum language, making your own quantum language, or learning more about where you can extend quantum compilation stacks with your own ideas, insights, and techniques, we hope you'll get something out of this book.
